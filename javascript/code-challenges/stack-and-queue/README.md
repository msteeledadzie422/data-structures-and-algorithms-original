# Stacks and Queues

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue.


## Challenge

1/ Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

2/ Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.

3/ Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
